Hey Roy, we're building GitHub for running a company by open-sourcing the way people work. Others can share their ways of doing things just like you did here and we can level up whole industries. I'd love to give you a product demo.

PS. We are a crazy team: [https://www.instagram.com/swipesapp](https://www.instagram.com/swipesapp/) (you asked for it :D). Passionate about building the happiest place to work. 5 Europeans in Palo Alto. Crunching on how people can work better for 3.5 years.
