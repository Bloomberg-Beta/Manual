We're reinventing how people work by combining human and machine intelligence. We still have a long way to go, but in order to reach our next milestone, we're raising a $200,000 Seed Round on a $3.2M Pre-Money Valuation.

We started a Facebook marketing campaign on June 1st to recruit freelancers and 1,000 people signed up in the first 4 days (this was our goal for the first 2 months, actually, but we hit it much earlier). In the beginning, 1 in 5 people that visited our website would sign up. Now it's almost 1 in 4 (24% conversion rate).

Our ads saw a 2.5% Click-Through Rate (CTR) when the average for all Facebook Ads is 1%, so ours did 250% better.

We're now at past 5,000 registered users out of which 45% submitted their applications and 80% are already approved for the next step of our recruiting process, which means they're real people. According to our statistics, around 1,500 candidates will finish our recruiting process with 30% being ready to work (Collaborators) while the others would still need to learn on our platform (Students). Either way, when they all reach a high enough level to work, for only 3 hours per day, 300 days per year, Collabos will be making $13.5M in profit. I can show you the exact calculations, of course.

Here's our one-and-a-half pages Executive Summary: http://bit.ly/collabos-summary
Here's our Pitch Deck: http://bit.ly/collabos-pitch
Here's a public traffic data: https://www.similarweb.com/website/collaboss.com (note, we jumped over 7.2 million websites in terms of incoming traffic in 1 month)

Of course, there's much more information available and I would be happy to talk to you about our startup. Can we setup a Skype/Google Hangouts conversation?

Have a great day,
