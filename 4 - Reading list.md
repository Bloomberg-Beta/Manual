# Bloomberg Beta reading List

The resources on this page cover a range of subjects we find useful to think about in our day-to-day lives as VCs. Like the rest of our manual, this is a living document, so please feel free to submit any suggestions via pull request! We included many pieces we've written in our core manual, so the below focuses on the work of others.

## Must-Reads

* [Co-intelligence: Living and Working with AI](https://bookshop.org/p/books/co-intelligence-living-and-working-with-ai-ethan-mollick/20812081?ean=9780593716717) by Ethan Mollick (book). Shows how executives and others can use AI in practice.
* [Malleable Software in the Age of AI](https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2023/03/25/llm-end-user-programming.html)  by Geoffrey Litt (blog). As companies compete to integrate AI into their products, everyone asks what's next. Geoffrey's article presents a vision for changes in software development.
* [Brotopia: Breaking Up the Boys' Club of Silicon Valley](https://bookshop.org/p/books/brotopia-breaking-up-the-boys-club-of-silicon-valley-emily-chang/12083505?ean=9780525540175) by Emily Chang (book). We’re committed to making the startup world more diverse and inclusive. Emily’s powerful exposé of the hidden (and not-so-hidden) sexism in Silicon Valley examines how we got here and the ways we can move forward to build companies that reflect an open and inclusive world.
* [Prediction Machines](https://bookshop.org/p/books/prediction-machines-updated-and-expanded-the-simple-economics-of-artificial-intelligence-ajay-agrawal/18058215?ean=9781647824679) by Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans, and Avi Goldfarb (book). From our friends at the University of Toronto, a simple framework from economics that (we think) is one of the smartest takes on business strategy in the age of AI.
* [AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order](https://bookshop.org/p/books/ai-superpowers-china-silicon-valley-and-the-new-world-order-kai-fu-lee/6960836) by Kai-Fu Lee (book). Experts predict AI will impact 60% of jobs in advanced economies. This article offers a perspective on AI's impending world-changing effects.
* [Cognitive Distortions of Founders](https://medium.com/@mcgd/the-cognitive-distortions-of-founders-8e96c1edf60b) by Michael Dearing (article). When evaluating early-stage startups, we seek reasons to believe a founding team is extraordinary. We’re inspired by this brief look into how some cognitive biases make for founders with superpowers.
* [Netflix Culture Deck](https://hbr.org/2014/01/how-netflix-reinvented-hr) (article). Netflix famously released their original culture deck in 2009 and built a high-performance culture by emphasizing honesty and open communication. We believe transparency is the first step to building trust with founders — who we see as our customers.
* [Money Stuff](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/topics/money-stuff) by Matt Levine (newsletter). One of our favorite columnists at Bloomberg Opinion, Matt’s daily newsletter provides an honest, insightful, and very entertaining take on what’s happening in the worlds of finance and tech.
* [#thisisnotadvice](https://www.thisisnotadvice.work) edited by Roy Bahat. A compendium of thoughts on how to thrive at work, by a community of experts and students.
